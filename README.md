## Trend-Analysis-of-students-performance-in-WASSCE-results-
Trend Analysis of students’ performance in WASSCE results of public and private schools from 2018 to 2022 in Ajeromi LGA, Lagos State. 

## Objectives
1.	Trend analysis of students’ performance in WASSCE
2.	Comparison of public and private school students’ performance in WASSCE
3.	Comparison of male and female performance 

## Methodology
The study centres on 3 STEM subjects: Maths, Physics and Chemistry. 
Data source: Secondary data sourced from the selected schools.
In this study, I chose 2 public schools and 2 private schools due to their population and visibility in the LGA.

Application Used: R programming language. At first, I tried using Tableau and Python but the visualization is short of what I wanted. The visualization from Excel spreadsheet was even the worse. However, the last app I used was R and the visualization was very impressive. 

I coded the WASSCE results: A1 = 75, B2 =70, B3 = 65, C4 = 60, D7 = 45, E8 = 40, and F9 = 39. 
Gender: 1 represent male; 2 represent female.

## Observations:
## Public School Performance Trend
### Fig 1: Public School Performance Trend
Students performed better in 2020 relative to other years. However, the performance declined after 2020. I will perform diagnostic analytics to reveal the possible causes.
Students performed poorer in 2018.
The trend line shows a progressive performance of students in WASSCE in the study area. 
Female students perform better than male students in 2018, 2019 and 2021, while male students only perform better than female students in 2020 and 2022.
Female students’ performance recorded a visible performance gap in the years they outperform male students. I will perform diagnostic analytics to reveal the possible causes. 

### Fig 2: Second Public School Performance Trend
One striking thing here is that this particular school outperformed every other school in WASSCE result performance metric in the study area. 
The female students were also leading in WASSCE performance trend.
In relative terms, this school performed better in 2021 and declined thereafter. 

## Private School Performance Trend

### Fig 5: Public and Private School Performance Trend combine
Here, the schools in Ajeromi LGA, Lagos State recorded a slight increase in WASSCE result performance. In general, the chart shows that male students slightly outperformed female students in 2022. 

## Conclusion:
The schools in Ajeromi LGA, Lagos State recorded a slight increase in WASSCE result performance between 2018 and 2022.
Public school perform better than private school in Ajeromi LGA, Lagos State between 2018 to 2022.
Female students performed better than male students but male students surpass female students in 2022.

## Recommendation: 
Both private and secondary schools in the study area need to study the template or the secret behind the success achieved by the public school in fig 2.
I collected primary data from the selected schools to probe more and conduct diagnostic analytics on the possible reasons the students’ performance in WASSCE in Ajeromi LGA, Lagos State has been increasing at a very slow pace. 
The quality of education in Ajeromi LGA, Lagos State need to be improved to increase students performance
